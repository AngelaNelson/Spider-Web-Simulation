# Spider-Web-Simulation
The aim behind building this project is to simulate a common, naturally occurring, yet beautiful phenomenon, a spider web. 
A spider web is one of the most uniform and natural patterns that we can find.
The project demonstrated the basic pattern of a spider web and also simulates the movement of a spider on it. 
It encompasses most of the Open GL concepts that were taught in the sixth semester. 
A few noteworthy features include: 
1. Usage of the RGB color scheme to set colors for the background, the object and so on. 
2. A menu-driven program where the color of the spider’s body changes in accordance to the menu option chosen.
3. Usage of Bitmap to render text on the screen.
4. Usage of scaling, rotation and translation to animate and move the spider. 
5. User interface through the keyboard. That is, pressing of certain keys stimulates the spider’s motion.
6. Usage of polygon drawing, line drawing and curve drawing functions to come up with the respective shapes and figures.
With all this included, the project displays a spider web with a spider on it , a spider that the user can move using the keys on the keyboard. 
Also, there is a menu that lets the user change the color schemes of the entire scene.
